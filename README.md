# INTELLIVOTE-AN-RFID-BASED-SMART-ELECTRONIC-VOTING-SYSTEM

🧑‍💻 Project Overview

This project is an RFID-based secure voting system designed and implemented using embedded systems concepts. The system ensures controlled voting access, authentication, real-time clock validation, and secure vote storage as well as preventing mutliple times voting by the same person.

The complete system is built by integrating multiple modules like LCD, Keypad, UART, EEPROM, I2C, RTC, and RFID reader, making it a real-time embedded application.
