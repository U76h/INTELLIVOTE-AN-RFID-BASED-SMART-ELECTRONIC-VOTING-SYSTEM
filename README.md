# INTELLIVOTE-AN-RFID-BASED-SMART-ELECTRONIC-VOTING-SYSTEM

🧑‍💻 Project Overview:

This project presents a secure and efficient RFID-based voting system developed using embedded systems. The main objective of this system is to ensure that only authorized voters can cast their vote within a defined time period, while maintaining data integrity and security.

The system integrates multiple hardware modules such as RFID reader, RTC, EEPROM, LCD, and keypad to create a real-time voting environment. It also includes a separate control mechanism for the election officer to manage voting operations like start, stop, result viewing, and system reset.

🛠️ Hardware Requirements:

The following components are used in this project:

--> Microcontroller (LPC2148)
-->RFID Reader Module 
-->RFID Tags (for voters and officer)
-->LCD Display (20X4)
-->Matrix Keypad(4X4)
--> I2C EEPROM(AT24C256) 
-->RTC Module (Real Time Clock)
-->LEDs (Red & Green)
-->Buzzer (optional)
-->Power Supply Unit

⚙️ Working Principle :

🔹 System Initialization

When the system is powered ON:
-->All peripherals (LCD, Keypad, UART, EEPROM, I2C, RTC) are initialized.
-->Project title is displayed on LCD.
-->The system reads the current date and time from the RTC to ensure that the clock is functioning properly.
